I joined the Danish smash scene in Summer '13, and found it very difficult to find basic information to get involved. After searching numerous places, I ended up searching the term 'Denmark' on Smashboards, and messaging anyone who mentioned that they lived there.

Once SmashEurope.com had launched, which seemed like a very useful resource for anyone who is new to the scene, new to a region, or plans to take their Smashing around the continent, I realised that a number of the homepages for each country were either lacking basic information, lacking maintenance or just didn't exist. Including Smash Denmark, whose website consists of just a forum.

So with the collaboration initially of the Danish smash group, taking into account their requirements for such a homepage, I've set out to build a template which can be used by any region that would like to use it, modify it, and build upon it.

tl;dr - Some smash homepages are bad, they can use this instead.
